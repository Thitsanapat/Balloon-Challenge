"""The launched flight has to stay JSON serializable for the submission packer.

``pack_for_submission`` runs the flight through ``RocketPyEncoder``. The flight
carries the rocket, the rocket carries its sensors, and a sensor hands back
whatever seed it was built with. A seed that has no JSON form therefore breaks
submission packing for every competitor, which is exactly what a ``SeedSequence``
seed did. Nothing covered that path before, on either side of the submodule.

Only ``rocketpy`` is guarded below: a missing simulation stack is a legitimate
skip, but a broken import inside this package is a failure and must stay loud.
