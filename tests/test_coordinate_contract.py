"""The coordinate datum the competition API exposes.

X and Y are measured from the launch point, but Z is altitude above sea level:
the rocket starts at ``z = elevation`` and a balloon 10 m above the pad reads
``elevation + 10``. Upstream RocketPy documents launch-site-relative positions
instead, so this is a fork-level divergence that a future submodule update could
silently reverse. Competitors aim with these numbers, so it is worth pinning.

Only ``rocketpy`` is guarded below: a missing simulation stack is a legitimate
skip, but a broken import inside this package is a failure and must stay loud.
