"""What the submission checker catches, and what it does not.

Every test here starts from a submission the environment actually produced and
then edits it, because a checker that passes a clean file proves nothing about
whether it would catch a dirty one. The edits are the ones somebody would
actually make: move a balloon onto the rocket's path, claim pops that did not
happen, raise the score.

Scenario 1 cut to a single balloon. Scenario 0 would be faster still and would
be useless: its balloons are static, so its flight array is identical at every
timestep and a comparison against it passes at any time offset at all. The
fixture asserts its balloon moves, so that cannot quietly become true again.
