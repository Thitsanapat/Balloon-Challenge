"""Golden-master regression test for scenario #1 (issue #38).

Scenario #1 differs from scenario #0 in two ways that matter here. First, the
balloons are not static: on ``reset`` the environment runs a *Monte Carlo*
ensemble of 100 balloon flights through the ECMWF ensemble atmosphere
(``TW_Cup`` NetCDF), so the balloons drift and the scenario is comparatively
expensive (~30 s wall clock per full run). Second, because the balloons move,
the balloon trajectories themselves carry physics that scenario #0 cannot guard
-- so this test compares the (downsampled) balloon positions in addition to the
rocket trajectory.

Both the Monte Carlo balloon ensemble and the rocket integration are seeded from
``scenario.random_seed`` (0), so a fixed agent produces a reproducible run. This
test re-runs it and compares against a committed baseline, guarding against
unintended changes to the physics (for example when ActiveRocketPy is updated).

Determinism: two full runs with seed 0 on the same machine are bit-identical
(observed max position delta 0.0 for both rocket and balloons). The tolerances
below therefore only absorb cross-platform float drift; see the constants.

The baseline is tied to the current (repository, ActiveRocketPy submodule)
state. When a physics change is *intended*, regenerate it deliberately with
``tests/baselines/regenerate_scenario_1.py`` and review the diff.

Cost / CI gating: this test is heavy, so it is gated behind the environment
variable ``BPC_RUN_SLOW_TESTS`` (the project has no pytest ``slow`` marker
infrastructure yet). The PR CI sets it, so the test runs there; a local run
without it is skipped. When the gate is on the simulation stack must import, so
an ImportError then fails loudly instead of skipping. Run it with::

    BPC_RUN_SLOW_TESTS=1 python -m pytest tests/test_scenario1_regression.py -v
