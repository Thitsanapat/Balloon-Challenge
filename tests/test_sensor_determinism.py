"""Integration test: sensor-noise determinism in the environment.

The competition's fairness model requires that, for a given announced scenario
seed, every competitor sees the *same* noisy sensor realization, reproducibly,
regardless of the process-global RNG state or how the run is parallelized (the
agent never sees the seed). Sensor noise is now drawn from a per-sensor
generator seeded from ``scenario.random_seed`` (decorrelated sub-streams), not
the process-global ``numpy.random``.

Scenarios #0/#1 ship with ideal (zero-noise) sensors, so this test switches on
non-zero noise to actually exercise the sensor RNG, then checks reproducibility.
Importing the env pulls in the simulation stack, so the test skips when that
stack is absent (mirroring the rest of the suite).
