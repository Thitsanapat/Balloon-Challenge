"""The submission no longer ships ``balloon_flights`` (issue #57).

That array was 71% of a scenario-1 submission and nothing read it. Dropping it
rests on one claim, so this pins the claim rather than only the removal: the
balloon data the array holds is already in ``trajectories``, one step across.

What a submission contains is asked of ``build_submission_payload`` directly.
The version this replaced captured it by mocking ``pickle.dump``, which tied the
contents to the encoding and would have broken on #58 replacing the encoder with
JSON. It also mocked ``utils.open``, which is not the write path:
``pack_for_submission`` goes through ``_write_atomically`` to ``mkstemp``,
``fsync`` and ``os.replace``, so with ``dump`` doing nothing the write still ran
and renamed an empty file into place. Every call left a finished-looking zero
byte submission in the package directory, 130 across the worktrees on one
machine. That the writer is reached at all is now its own test, with the writer
mocked at its own boundary.

Only ``rocketpy`` is guarded: a missing simulation stack is a legitimate skip,
but a broken import inside this package is a failure and must stay loud.
