"""Golden-master regression test for scenario #0 (issue #38).

Scenario #0 is deterministic -- static balloons, a fixed seed, ideal sensors and
no Monte Carlo -- so a fixed agent produces a reproducible rocket trajectory.
This test re-runs it and compares against a committed baseline, guarding against
unintended changes to the physics (for example when ActiveRocketPy is updated).

The baseline is tied to the current (repository, ActiveRocketPy submodule) state.
When a physics change is *intended*, regenerate it deliberately with
``tests/baselines/regenerate_scenario_0.py`` and review the diff.

Scope (v1): the popped-balloon count (exact) and the rocket position trajectory
(~3% tolerance). Attitude and velocity are intentionally left for a later
iteration to keep this guard small and its tolerances simple.
