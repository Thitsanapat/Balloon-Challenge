"""What the environment does with an action it cannot use.

A policy that diverges emits NaN, and it is the most ordinary failure there is
while training one. Measured on the pin these tests were written against: a
single NaN in `tvc` was harmless, the run finished with the same score as a
clean one, while a NaN in `launch_inclination_heading` raised
`ValueError: All components of the initial state y0 must be finite` and ended
the evaluation. ActiveRocketPy #19 makes the actuator setters refuse a
non-finite command too, so without this the first kind becomes the second.

The rule here is that a field the environment cannot use is dropped, the
actuator keeps what it holds, and the episode carries on. A run is not lost to
one bad step.
