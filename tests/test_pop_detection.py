"""Unit tests for the balloon pop-detection geometry.

Pop detection is the scoring mechanism: a balloon is popped when the swept path
of the rocket passes within ``balloon.radius`` of the balloon over a timestep.
The geometry lives in two pure-numpy helpers on ``BalloonPoppingEnv``:

* ``_segment_distance_squared_batch`` -- squared minimum distance between one
  segment (the rocket sweep) and N segments (the balloon sweeps).
* ``_detect_pops`` -- flips released balloons (status 1) to popped (status 2)
  when that squared distance is within the squared radius.

``_segment_distance_squared_batch`` is a pure function; ``_detect_pops`` is not,
since flipping the status is the whole point of it. Importing the env module
pulls in the simulation stack, so these are guarded with ``skipUnless`` like the
other runtime tests.
