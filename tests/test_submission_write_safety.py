Three properties, none of which the format change in #58 should be allowed to

* the output path stays inside the results directory whatever ``team_name`` says;
* a write that fails part way through leaves no truncated submission and no
  leftover temp file behind;
* two runs in the same second do not land on the same path.

Only ``rocketpy`` is guarded: a missing simulation stack is a legitimate skip,
