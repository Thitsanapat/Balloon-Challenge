"""Comparing a trajectory against its baseline, shared by both scenarios.

Kept in one place rather than copied into each regression test. The two copies
had already drifted: scenario 1's was covered by its own tests while scenario
0's had a broadcasting bug in the same few lines, and nothing could see it
because each file only tested its own copy.

# One bound, on the 3D displacement, in absolute terms.
#
# It replaces the per-coordinate max(1 m, 3% of |expected|) rather than joining
# it. That check could never fail on its own: failing it needs some |delta_i| to
# exceed a floor of 1 m, and the displacement is at least |delta_i|, so this cap
# had already failed. Over two million random cases the per-coordinate check
# fired without this one exactly zero times, while this one fired without it a
# million times. Keeping both would have left a branch no test could tell the
# presence of from the absence of.
#
# Deliberately not a fraction of |expected|.
#
# Z in this frame is altitude above sea level, not height above the launch
# site, so |expected| is dominated by where the coordinate origin happens to be
# rather than by anything about the trajectory. A relative bound therefore grows
# with altitude: on the committed scenario 0 baseline, 3% of |expected| exceeds
# the 1.5 m balloon radius at 108 of the 119 sampled points and reaches 48.8 m
# at apogee. That is not a bound on trajectory error, it is a bound on distance
# from sea level.
#
# Half a metre, sized from the measured drift. Two runs on one machine are bit
# identical, and so are runs on numpy 2.4.5/scipy 1.17.1 versus numpy
# 2.5.1/scipy 1.18.0, which is the spread between the lockfile and what CI
# resolves. Cross-machine regeneration moves the last few significant digits.
# So this is several orders of magnitude of headroom either way.
#
# Half rather than a whole metre because scenario 1 applies this cap to the
# rocket and to the balloons separately. Pop detection depends on the distance
# between them, and two independent errors of the full cap in opposite
# directions move that distance by twice the cap. At half a metre the combined
# worst case is 1 m, under the 1.5 m radius; at a whole metre it was 2 m, over
# it. TestTheCapStaysBelowTheRadius asserts the doubled figure.
#
# That comparison is a sanity check on the size of the bound, not a proof that
# a score cannot change. Pop detection sweeps between timesteps while this
# compares downsampled samples, so a bound on sampled positions does not bound
# every swept segment. It says the tolerance is far tighter than the scale at
# which scoring behaviour turns over, which is what it is for.

    is more than the balloon radius the score depends on.

    Non-finite values are rejected across the *whole* of both arrays, before
    anything is sliced away. Checking after the slice looked equivalent and was
    not: a diverged value in the one extra row the count tolerance allows was
    discarded before it could reach the norm, so the comparison passed on
    exactly the tail a golden master exists to catch.

    The row count is checked first, so a truncated trajectory cannot pass
