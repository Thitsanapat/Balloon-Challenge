"""Behavioural test for issue #2: Monte Carlo output must not land in the package dir.

`MonteCarlo` writes `.inputs/.outputs/.errors.txt` next to its `filename`. The
balloon env only consumes the in-memory results, so that path must be a
writable temp location, not the installed package directory (which can be
read-only, e.g. a site-packages install).

Runtime test: needs the simulation stack. Skips cleanly when it is absent.
