"""The output an entry point actually produces.

The existing logging test checks that two loggers exist and that ``close``
emits something. That leaves the part a user sees untested: whether the CLI
still prints the same line, whether anything is printed at all when
``evaluate_scenario`` is called from a script or a notebook, and whether the
engine's own records end up mixed into it.

Most of this simulates nothing. The two termination records at the bottom are
the exception: reaching them needs a real episode, and one of them needs a real
flight. An earlier version of this file drove the real
CLI against the shipped config, which renders with Matplotlib, writes a
trajectory file into the package directory, makes a network request to GitHub
and writes a submission carrying the team secret, all to check a formatter. It
went red in CI on a Matplotlib version difference that has nothing to do with
logging.
