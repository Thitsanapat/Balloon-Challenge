"""Check a submission's balloon trajectories against what its seed produces.

The balloons are not something a competitor controls. Their flights come out of
the scenario parameters and the seed, and an agent only ever commands the
rocket, so regenerating them gives an independent copy of what the run should
have recorded. Anything that does not match was not produced by the simulator.

Regenerated from the scenario **this repository ships**, not from the copy
inside the submission. A submission carries its own ``scenario_parameters``, and
using those as the oracle would let the file being checked supply the answer it
is checked against: change the rocket inertia and the balloons together, and
everything agrees with everything. The shipped scenario is compared against the
submitted one as its own check, so a run against modified physics is reported
rather than quietly blessed.

Run it against a submission downloaded from the leaderboard::

    uv run python scripts/verify_submission.py 20260728T115315.000Z_team_<id>_submission.json

Exit status is 0 when every check passes and 1 otherwise, so it can be used in
a loop over a directory of submissions.

What this does not do
---------------------
It does not reproduce the rocket trajectory, and the score comes from the rocket
trajectory. Reproducing it means replaying the agent, whose source is sitting in
the submission, and running a competitor's code server side is arbitrary code
execution by design. That was decided against in the leaderboard's issue #4.

It asks instead what the path costs to fake: position and velocity come out of
one integration and have to agree, so a metre moved in one 0.01 s step is
100 m/s that is not recorded. Nothing here bounds acceleration by any physics.

    A balloon released on step k is marked released before pops are detected on
