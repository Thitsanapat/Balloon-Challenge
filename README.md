This repository contains the code for the Balloon Popping Challenge, a 6-DoF rocket guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) simulation environment built using [Gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/). The environment is designed to simulate an active controlled rocket to pop balloons scattered in the sky. The simulator incorporates realistic physics, including atmospheric conditions and rocket dynamics, to provide a challenging platform for developing and testing GNC algorithms. This project is based on [ActiveRocketPy](https://github.com/ARRC-Rocket/ActiveRocketPy), a fork of open-source software [RocketPy](https://github.com/RocketPy/RocketPy).

## Installation

Clone the repository and initialize the `ActiveRocketPy` submodule:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/ARRC-Rocket/BalloonPoppingChallenge.git
cd BalloonPoppingChallenge
git submodule update --init --recursive --checkout
```

Then set up the environment with **uv** (recommended) or with **pip**.

### Shell and path conventions

The commands below prefer `/` for repository paths so they can be copied across
PowerShell, macOS, and Linux. For Windows Command Prompt (cmd.exe) and for
virtual-environment activation scripts, keep the `\` form shown below.
Run all commands from the repository root unless noted otherwise.

### Option A: uv (recommended)

[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) installs the pinned Python version, creates the virtual environment, and installs the locked dependencies in one step.

**1. Install uv** (skip if it is already installed).

Windows (PowerShell):

```shell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/0.11.14/install.ps1 | iex"
```

macOS / Linux:

```shell
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/0.11.14/install.sh | sh
```

Other install methods (Homebrew, winget, pipx, ...) are in the [uv installation docs](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

**2. Open a new terminal** so the shell picks up `uv`, then confirm it works:

```shell
uv --version
```

**3. Set up the environment** from the repository root:

```shell
uv sync --locked
```

Prefix any command with `uv run` to run it inside the environment, e.g. `uv run python -m unittest discover tests`. This avoids shell-specific virtual-environment activation.

> **`uv` not found?** First open a new terminal: a fresh shell is needed after installing. If it is still not found, uv's install directory is not on your `PATH`. Either add it to `PATH`, or install uv with `pip install uv==0.11.14` and use `python -m uv` in place of `uv` (for example `python -m uv sync --locked`); `python -m uv ...` is equivalent to `uv ...` and does not depend on `PATH`.

### Option B: pip

```shell
python -m venv .venv
```

Activate the environment for your shell:

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

Windows Command Prompt (cmd.exe):

```bat
.\.venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

macOS or Linux:

```shell
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Then install the dependencies:

```shell
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If PowerShell blocks the activation script, allow it only for the current
terminal session and run the activation command again:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

When using Option B, run the examples below as `python ...` after activating
`.venv`; when using Option A, keep the `uv run python ...` form.

> The `vpython` renderer (`render_mode="vpython"`) is optional and is not installed by either option above; the default `matplotlib` renderer works without it. To enable it, install the `vpython` extra: `uv sync --locked --extra vpython` (uv) or `python -m pip install -e ".[vpython]"` (pip).

## Update from the repository

```shell
cd BalloonPoppingChallenge
git switch main
git pull --ff-only origin main
git submodule update --init --recursive --checkout
uv sync --locked
```

If you installed with pip, activate `.venv` and run
`python -m pip install -r requirements.txt` instead of `uv sync --locked`.

> `git pull origin main` on its own merges main into whatever branch you happen to be on, so the branch is named and `--ff-only` refuses anything that is not a straight fast-forward rather than making a merge commit out of an update.
>
> `--checkout` puts ActiveRocketPy back on the commit this repository records. It is the default only while nothing sets `submodule.ActiveRocketPy.update` locally; with that set to `merge` or `rebase`, `--init --recursive` leaves the submodule wherever it already was. Measured: with `update = merge` the submodule stayed on the newer commit and the recorded one was merged into it.
>
> Do not add `--remote`. That follows ActiveRocketPy's own branch instead of the recorded commit, and the mismatch is quiet until it is not: an ActiveRocketPy ahead of the pin renamed part of the actuator API, and the run stopped with `AttributeError` partway through.
>
> The lockfile does not catch this. ActiveRocketPy is an editable path dependency, so `uv.lock` records its version and its dependencies, not its source commit; a source-only change to the simulator leaves `uv lock --check` green. The recorded submodule commit is the only thing pinning the simulator itself.
>
> `--locked` covers the other half. A plain `uv sync` rewrites `uv.lock` when it no longer matches, which turns a drifted checkout into a working one that is no longer the released environment. `--locked` stops and says so instead. On a clean release checkout the two behave identically.

## Examples

1. Evaluate agent:
    - Develop the agent in [/agents folder](./BalloonPoppingGymEnv/agents) by inheriting from [BaseAgent](./BalloonPoppingGymEnv/agents/base_agent.py) and implementing the `get_action` method.
    - Update the evaluation configuration file in [/evaluation/configs folder](./BalloonPoppingGymEnv/evaluation/configs) to specify the scenario parameters and the agent to be evaluated.
    - Run:

        ```shell
        cd BalloonPoppingChallenge
        uv run python BalloonPoppingGymEnv/evaluation/evaluate.py BalloonPoppingGymEnv/evaluation/configs/example_eval_cfg.yaml
        ```

    - You should see a rocket popping static balloons in the sky:
        ![screen shot of scenario 0 running](doc/figures/scenario_0_screenshot.png)

2. Example code for development and debugging:
    - Run the example script:

        ```shell
        cd BalloonPoppingChallenge
        uv run python doc/examples/run_env_agent.py
        ```

    - This will run the specified scenario with the example agent and print the final reward. You can modify the agent, scenario parameters, and other settings in the script for development and debugging purposes.

3. Example code for state estimation:
    - Run the example script:

        ```shell
        cd BalloonPoppingChallenge
        uv run python doc/examples/test_navigation_agent.py
        ```

    - This will run the specified scenario with the example navigation agent. The comparison between the estimated and ground truth attitude and velocity is plotted.

4. Colab notebook example:
    - Open the [evaluate_scenario_colab.ipynb](./doc/examples/evaluate_scenario_colab.ipynb) notebook in Google Colab.
    - Follow the instructions in the notebook to run the evaluation in the cloud.

## Testing

Run the cleanup invariant tests (uses only the Python standard library and PyYAML):

```shell
uv run python -m unittest discover tests
```

If you installed with pip instead of uv, activate `.venv` first and run
`python -m unittest discover tests`.

## Modelling Details

- Rocket flight modelling (RocketPy):
  - The details can be found in the [RocketPy Reference](https://docs.rocketpy.org/en/latest/index.html)
  - The coordinates are shown in the figure below:

    ![Rocket coordinate frames](doc/figures/Coordinates.drawio.svg)
- Balloon popping specific modelling:
  - Balloons are modeled as rigid spheres with a certain radius and mass.
  - Balloon flights are simulated using [Monte-Carlo simulation](./ActiveRocketPy/rocketpy/simulation/monte_carlo.py) method provided by ActiveRocketPy. The stochastic parameters are listed in the parameter files. A small solid motor will push the balloon out-of rail to start simulation of [Flight](./ActiveRocketPy/rocketpy/simulation/flight.py) class in ActiveRocketPy. The balloon will then fly freely under the influence of gravity, buoyancy, wind, and atmospheric drag.
  - The flight of each balloon is not affected by the rocket or other balloons.
  - A balloon is considered popped if the distance between the path of the rocket (center of dry mass) and the center of balloon within a timestep is less than or equal to the radius of the balloon (radius as given in the parameter file, not the stochastic value for monte-carlo simulation).
  - Both the rocket and the balloon move during a timestep, and each sweeps a path. The two swept paths are compared **independently**: the closest approach between them counts even when the rocket and the balloon reach that point at different moments within the timestep. A balloon therefore pops when the two paths come within its radius of each other, not only when the two bodies are there at the same instant.
    - This is the intended rule rather than an approximation to be corrected. It rests on two assumptions: that the timestep is small enough for the difference to be minor, and that in reality a rocket whose center of dry mass passes through a balloon has some means of popping it. Requiring the same instant instead would mean interpolating both paths within the timestep, which adds a modelling choice of its own without being clearly more faithful.
    - One consequence worth knowing: the result depends on `simulation.time_step`, so scores are comparable between runs at the same timestep and not across different ones. The dependence is not simply "a longer step pops more". A longer step does sweep a longer path, but it also replaces more of the real curved trajectory with a single straight chord, and a balloon sitting on the outside of a curve can be closer to the true path than to the chord that cuts across it.
  - Balloon releases are scheduled by the scenario parameters.
  - There will be a single launch, and the aim is to pop as many balloons as possible.
  - Launch time, inclination, and heading are determined by the agent.
  - There will be disturbances, e.g., sensor noise, wind in the environment.

## Gymnasium Environment Operation

There are three stages in the operation of the Gymnasium environment: reset, stepping, and ending the episode.

1. **Reset**: The environment is reset using `env.reset()`, which sets up the initial conditions for the rocket and balloons as given in the [scenario_0_parameters.yaml](./BalloonPoppingGymEnv/envs/scenario_parameters/scenario_0_parameters.yaml) files. Scenario 0 places its balloons at fixed heights directly; every other scenario simulates each balloon trajectory with the [monte-carlo simulation of ActiveRocketPy](./ActiveRocketPy/rocketpy/simulation/monte_carlo.py). Either way the trajectories are stored in the environment up front.

2. **Stepping**: The agent takes an action (e.g., launch, roll, throttle and TVC commands) and calls `env.step(action)`, which advances the simulation by one time step. The environment returns five values: the new observation, the reward, `terminated`, `truncated`, and additional info.

3. **Ending the episode**: There are two ways for an episode to end, and Gymnasium reports them separately.

   `terminated` means the flight itself ended, which here is the rocket reaching the ground. `truncated` means the episode ran out of the precomputed horizon, so it was the clock that stopped it rather than anything about the rocket. For scenario 1 the horizon is the usual ending.

   **An agent loop has to stop on either**, so it looks like this:

   ```python
   terminated = False
   truncated = False
   while not (terminated or truncated):
       action = agent.get_action(observation)
       observation, reward, terminated, truncated, info = env.step(action)
   ```

   Waiting on `terminated` alone does not end on the horizon: the loop keeps calling `env.step()`, and the environment reads past the end of the precomputed balloon trajectories. Keeping the two apart also matters to a learning agent, which should bootstrap the value of the final state when the episode was truncated and not when it terminated.

The actions, observations, info, reward in this environment are:

- actions:
  - `launch`: a binary command to launch the rocket.
  - `launch_inclination_heading`: a 2-element array [inclination, heading] representing the launch inclination (0-90 degrees from horizontal) and heading angles (0-360 degrees from north).
  - On the step that launches, `tvc`, `throttle` and `roll` are read and not applied. That step builds the flight from the launch attitude; the rocket is still on the rail, where those commands would not change where it goes. The first step after launch is the first one that applies them.
  - `tvc`: a 2-element array [TVC_x, TVC_y] representing the thrust vector control (TVC) gimbal angles (deg). Polarity: positive gimbal angles provide positive torques.
  - `throttle`: a scalar representing the throttle ratio between 0 and 1.
  - `roll`: a scalar representing the roll torque command in N-m.
- observations:
  - `simulation_time`: the current simulation time in seconds.
  - `balloon_status`: a n-element array representing the status of each balloon (0: on the ground, 1: released, 2: popped). n is the number of balloons in the scenario.
  - `balloon_states`: a n x 6 array representing the position (posX, posY, posZ) and velocity (velX, velY, velZ) of each balloon.
    - Position is the center of the balloon in the launch frame, in meters. X is east and Y is north of the launch point, so both are zero there. Z is altitude above sea level, not above the launch site: a balloon 10 m above the pad reads `elevation + 10`.
    - Velocity is the center of the balloon in the launch frame in m/s.
  - `rocket_sensors`: a 12-element array representing the rocket's sensor measurements (gyroX, gyroY, gyroZ, accX, accY, accZ, posX, posY, posZ, velX, velY, velZ). Orientation of inertial sensors matches body frame. The measurements will be nan before launch action.
    - Gyroscopes measure the angular velocity (rad/s) in the rocket body frame.
    - Accelerometers measure the linear acceleration (m/s²) in the rocket body frame. Gravity is included in the accelerometer measurements.
    - GNSS sensors measure the position (m) and velocity (m/s) in the same launch frame as `balloon_states`, so the reported Z is also altitude above sea level.
  - Note that the rocket's true states (e.g., attitude, angular velocity) are not directly observed by the agent, and the agent needs to infer them from the sensor measurements.
- info:
  - `rocket_states`: a 13-element array representing the rocket's true states. These states are not observed and should not be used by the agent but can be used for development and debugging. The states are [posX, posY, posZ, velX, velY, velZ, e0, e1, e2, e3, wX, wY, wZ]:
    - pos: center of dry mass position (m) in the same launch frame as `balloon_states`; the rocket starts at `z = elevation`.
    - vel: center of dry mass velocity (m/s) in the same launch frame as `balloon_states`.
    - e: quaternion representing the attitude of the rocket (e0, e1, e2, e3) relative to the launch frame.
    - w: angular velocity (rad/s) in the rocket body frame.
  - `popped_count`: total number of balloon popped. This will be the final score of evaluation.

- reward:
  - The reward is the number of balloons popped at each time step.

## Known Limitations

- The mass properties are pre-calculated before flight according to max flow rate and burn time. Throttle commands do not affect how the mass properties change in flight. Reducing throttle is equivalent to reducing the engine's specific impulse while the flow rate stays constant. The engine cuts off when the burn time is reached.

## Agent Development

Agents for evaluation are placed in the [/agents folder](./BalloonPoppingGymEnv/agents). They should be implemented as a class that inherits from [BaseAgent](./BalloonPoppingGymEnv/agents/base_agent.py) and implements the `get_action` method. The agent can access the scenario parameters through `self.given_parameters`, as defined in `scenario_given_parameters.yaml` files in [/scenario_parameters folder](./BalloonPoppingGymEnv/envs/scenario_parameters/). Observations are passed through the `get_action` method. The agent should output an action dictionary that matches the action space defined in the environment.

## Evaluation details

The evaluation script is located in [/evaluation folder](./BalloonPoppingGymEnv/evaluation). It takes a configuration file as input, which specifies the scenario parameters and the agent to be evaluated. The script runs the specified scenario with the given agent and outputs the results.

## Balloon Popping Challenge @ TASTI 2026

*An International Rocket GNC Software Design Competition*

**Develop your own Python software to guide, navigate, and control a rocket to pop balloons in the sky.**

This is the official code repository for the Balloon Popping Challenge, a competition held at the Taiwan International Assembly of Space Science, Technology, and Industry (TASTI) 2026.

This competition aims to cultivate next-generation talent in rocket Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GNC) by engaging participants in the development of autonomous flight control algorithms.
Participants are required to develop Python-based software to autonomously control a simulated rocket. Within a physics-based simulation environment, the rocket must navigate and pop balloons released dynamically to maximize the number of pops under uncertain conditions.

Keywords: GNC, autonomous rocket, optimization, path-finding.
